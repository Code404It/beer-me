# Beer Me
This is a simple project that goes back to the basics. 
The main focus of this project is the fetch() method. 
It takes one argument, which is the path to the resource that you want to fetch.
It returns a promise that resolves the response of that request. (Promises have 3 phases PENDING, FULFILLED, REJECTED)

A fetch is a simple get request downloading the content of the request passed through it. 

The purpose of this project is just to play around with a beers to see what you might be in the mood to drink. 
It's for anyone who enjoys beer.
